| **Concept**                  | **Java**                                        | **C#**                                                 | **Notes**

| Default behavior             | Methods are virtual by default                 | Methods are non-virtual by default                     | Java allows overriding without annotation; C# requires `virtual` and `override`.
| Method overriding            | Implicit if signatures match                  | Requires `override` keyword                            | Ensures developer intent in C#.
| Method hiding                | Only applies to static methods                | Applies to all methods; use `new` keyword              | Hiding breaks polymorphism in C#.
| Runtime behavior             | Uses runtime type to resolve method call      | Virtual methods use runtime type; non-virtual use reference type | Java always favors runtime type for non-static methods.
| Versioning issue: same signature | Overrides method unintentionally              | Compiler warning if hiding not explicit                | Java may break expected base behavior after update.
| Versioning issue: different return type | Compile error if return types mismatch     | Compile error                                           | Both languages block override if return types are incompatible.
| Final / Sealed methods       | Use `final` to prevent override               | Use `sealed` (with `override`)                         | C# only allows sealing overridden members, not base declarations.
| Access to base class method  | `super.method()`                              | `base.Method()`                                        | Same purpose and syntax.
| New virtual member in hierarchy | Not supported as concept                    | Use `new virtual` for new specialization point         | Introduces a new override chain in derived classes.
| Compiler protection          | No warning for accidental hiding              | Warning if `new` not used when hiding a member         | C# enforces clarity between override vs hide.
| Method type check            | `instanceof`                                  | `is` operator                                          | Used to validate object type before casting.
| Static methods and hiding    | Static methods can be hidden, not overridden  | Static methods can be hidden with `new`                | Neither language allows overriding static methods.
