| **Concept**                    | **Java**                        | **C#**                                | **Notes**

| Assignment Operator             | `=`                             | `=`                                   | Same syntax for assigning values to variables.
| Arithmetic Operators            | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`         | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`               | Same syntax for basic arithmetic operations.
| Increment/Decrement Operators   | `++`, `--`                      | `++`, `--`                            | Same syntax for incrementing or decrementing values.
| Comparison Operators            | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` | `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`       | Same comparison operators for equality, inequality, and relational checks.
| Logical Operators               | `&&`, `||`, `!`                 | `&&`, `||`, `!`                       | Same logical operators for AND, OR, and NOT.
| Bitwise Operators               | `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` | `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` | Same syntax for bitwise operations. C# also supports the unsigned right shift (`>>>`).
| Conditional (Ternary) Operator  | `condition ? expr1 : expr2`     | `condition ? expr1 : expr2`           | Same syntax for the ternary conditional operator.
| Null Coalescing Operator        | N/A                             | `??`                                  | C# has the null-coalescing operator (`??`) to check for null values.
| Null Conditional Operator       | N/A                             | `?.`                                  | C# uses `?.` to safely access members of an object that might be null.
| String Concatenation            | `+`                             | `+`                                   | Both use `+` for concatenating strings.
| Type Cast Operator              | `(Type) value`                  | `(Type) value`                        | Same syntax for casting a value to a specific type.
| `is` Operator                   | N/A                             | `is`                                  | C# uses `is` for type checking (e.g., `obj is Type`).
| `instanceof` Operator           | `instanceof`                    | N/A                                   | Java uses `instanceof` for type checking, while C# uses `is`.
| `new` Operator                  | `new`                           | `new`                                 | Both use `new` for object creation.
| `sizeof` Operator               | N/A                             | `sizeof`                              | C# supports `sizeof` to get the size of a type, but Java does not have a direct equivalent.
| `await` Keyword                 | N/A                             | `await`                               | C# uses `await` for asynchronous programming, while Java handles it with `CompletableFuture` or similar approaches.
| `async` Keyword                 | N/A                             | `async`                               | C# uses `async` to define asynchronous methods, while Java uses different approaches for concurrency.
