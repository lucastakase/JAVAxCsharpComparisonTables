| Addition and Subtraction     | `+`, `-`                        | `+`, `-`                            | Same precedence for addition and subtraction.
| Bitwise shift operators      | `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`               | `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`                   | Same precedence for bitwise shifts.

| Bitwise OR                   | `|`                             | `|`                                 | Same precedence for bitwise OR.

| Conditional (ternary) operator | `? :`                          | `? :`                               | Same precedence for ternary operator.
| Assignment operators         | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`    | Same precedence for assignment operators.

| `new` operator               | `new`                           | `new`                               | Same precedence for object creation using `new`.

| `await` (C# only)            | N/A                             | `await`                             | C# uses `await` for asynchronous programming; has specific precedence when used in async operations.
| `async` (C# only)            | N/A                             | `async`                             | C# uses `async` for defining asynchronous methods, which has its own precedence when used.
